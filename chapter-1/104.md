## 1.4 What else can Copilot do for us?

As we’ve seen, we can use Copilot to write Python code for us starting from an English description of what we want. Programmers use the word _syntax_ to refer to the symbols and words that are valid in a given language. So, we can say that Copilot takes a description in English syntax and gives us back code in Python syntax. That's a big win, because learning programming syntax has historically been a major stumbling block for new programmers. What kind of bracket— \[, (, or { —am I supposed to use here? Do I need indentation here or not? What's the order that we're supposed to write these things: x and then y, or y and then x?

Such questions abound and let's be honest: it's uninteresting stuff. Who cares about this when all we want to do is write a program to make something happen? Copilot can help free us from the tedium of syntax. We see this as an important step to help more people successfully write programs, and we look forward to the day when this artificial barrier is completely removed. For now, we still need Python syntax, but at least Copilot helps us with it.

But that's not all Copilot can do. Here are some associated—and no less important—tasks where Copilot can help us:

* **Explaining code**. When Copilot generates Python code for us, we’ll need to determine whether that code does what we want. Again, as we said above, Copilot is going to make mistakes. We’re not interested in teaching you every nuance of how Python works (that’s the old model of programming). We _are_ going to teach you how to read Python code to gain an overall understanding of what it does. But we’re also going to use the feature of Copilot that explains code to you in English. When you finish with this book and our explanations, you’ll still have Copilot available to help you understand that next bit of gnarly code that it gives you.

* **Making code easier to understand**. There are many different ways to write code to accomplish the same task. Some of them may be easier to understand than others. Copilot has a tool that can reorganize your code to make it easier for you to work with. For example, code that’s easier to read is often easier to enhance or fix when needed.

* **Fixing bugs**. A _bug_ is a mistake made when writing a program that can result in the program doing the wrong thing. Sometimes, you’ll have some Python code, and it almost works, or works almost always but not in one specific circumstance. If you’ve listened to programmers talk, you may have heard the common story where a programmer would spend hours only to finally remove one = symbol that was making their program fail. Not a fun few hours! In these cases, you can try the Copilot feature that helps to automatically find and fix the bug in the program.
