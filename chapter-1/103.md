## 1.3 How Copilot changes how we learn to program

To illustrate how learning to program changes in the presence of an AI Assistant, we want to show you how powerful Copilot is at solving a programming task typically given to students in the middle of a programming course or in a book on how to program.

When learning how to program in the past, learners often spent most of their time learning how to work with the syntax and basic structure of programs. Being able to write a program from scratch (line-by-line), like the one we’ll show you below, is seen as the culmination of all of their learning. Before we dive into the problem, we need to be clear: many new programmers cannot write the code to solve this problem despite the fact most programming instructors (and book authors) think that new programmers should be able to do so. Here are the instructions for one version of this problem \[6\].

“Write a program that will read the amount of rainfall for each day. A negative value of rainfall should be rejected since this is invalid and inadmissible. The program should print out the number of valid recorded days, the number of rainy days, the rainfall over the period, and the maximum amount of rain that fell on any one day. Use a sentinel value of 9999 to terminate the program.”

If you have tried to learn to program before, this kind of problem statement may be familiar to you, and you may have struggled to solve such a problem.

  

But now, if we give exactly this prompt to Copilot, we get the following Python code as a result. (Remember from the Introduction that Copilot is nondeterministic, so if we ask it again, we might get different code!)



**Listing 1.1 Copilot code that solves the classic rainfall problem.**

```python
rainfall = 0
total_rainfall = 0
num_rainy_days = 0
num_valid_days = 0
max_rainfall = 0
rainfall = int(input("Enter the amount of rainfall for the day: "))
while rainfall != 9999:
    if rainfall < 0:
         print("Invalid rainfall amount. Please try again.")
         rainfall = int(input("Enter the amount of rainfall for the day: ")
    else:
         num_valid_days += 1
         total_rainfall += rainfall
         if rainfall > 0:
             num_rainy_days += 1
         if rainfall > max_rainfall:
             max_rainfall = rainfall
         rainfall = int(input("Enter the amount of rainfall for the day: ")
print("Number of valid days:", num_valid_days)
print("Number of rainy days:", num_rainy_days)
print("Total rainfall over the period:", total_rainfall)
print("Maximum amount of rain that fell on any one day:", max_rainfall)
```


We’re not expecting you to have any intuition right now that this code is good. But it is. As Computer Science Professors, we’d grade this code very highly.

People learning to program used to spend weeks or months to get to a point where they could write programs like this. Now Copilot can offer code immediately. As we’ll see in the rest of the book, we still need to work to verify that this code is correct because Copilot can make mistakes. However, we don’t need to write it from scratch anymore. We believe this successful interaction with Copilot signals the end of the way that we have historically taught and learned programming.

You, as someone interested in learning how to program, simply don’t need to struggle with syntax, control flow, and the host of other Python concepts needed to write code like this as you had to in the past. Sure, we are going to learn about those concepts in this book, but not so that you can demonstrate your understanding by writing code from scratch that Copilot can produce easily. No, we’ll learn those concepts only inasmuch as they help us solve meaningful problems and interact productively with Copilot. **Instead, you get to learn how to write larger, more meaningful software faster, because of how an AI-Assistant fundamentally changes the skills needed to learn to program.**
