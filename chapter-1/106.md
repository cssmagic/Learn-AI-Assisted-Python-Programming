## 1.6 The skills we need

If Copilot can write our code, explain it, and fix bugs in it, are we just done? Do we just tell Copilot what to do and celebrate our pure awesomeness?

No. It's true that some of the skills that programmers rely upon (writing correct syntax, for example) will decrease in importance. But other skills remain critical. For example, you cannot throw a huge task at Copilot like,

  

"Make a video game. Oh, and make it fun." Copilot will fail. Instead, we need to break down such a large problem into smaller tasks that Copilot can help us with. And how do we break a problem down like that? Not easily, it turns out. This is a key skill that humans need to hone in their conversations with tools like Copilot, and a skill that we will teach throughout the book.

Other skills, believe it or not, may take on even more importance with Copilot than without. Testing code has always been a critical task in writing code that works. We know a lot about testing code written by humans, because we know where to look for typical problems. We know that humans often make programming errors at the boundaries of values. For example, if we wrote a program to multiply two numbers, it’s likely that we’d get it right with most values but maybe not for when one value is 0. What about code written by AI, where twenty lines of flawless code could hide one line so absurd that we likely wouldn't expect it there? We don’t have experience with that. We need to test even more carefully than before.

Finally, some required skills are entirely new. The main one here is called _prompt engineering_, which involves how to tell Copilot what to do. When we're asking Copilot to write some code, we're using a _prompt_ to make the request. It's true that we can use English to write that prompt and ask for what we want, but that alone isn't enough. We need to be very precise if we want Copilot to have any chance of doing the right thing. And even when we are precise, Copilot may still do the wrong thing. In that case, we need to first identify that Copilot has indeed made a mistake, and then tweak our description to hopefully nudge it in the right direction. In our experience, seemingly minor changes to the prompt can have outsized effects on what Copilot produces.

In this book, we will teach you all of these skills.
