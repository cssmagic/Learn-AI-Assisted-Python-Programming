# 11 Future Directions
# 第十一章 展望未来

### This chapter covers
### 本章内容概要

* Using prompt patterns to write and explain code
* Current limitations and future directions of generative AI tools

In this final chapter, we want to give you a glimpse of the creative ways people are currently using generative AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT. For example, it’s possible to make Copilot Chat ask you the questions, rather than the other way around. And it’s possible to make Copilot take on a different persona to be even more helpful to your current programming task. We’re going to keep this brief, and it’s not clear how much of this will become standard practice, but we want to take this opportunity to demonstrate the power of being creative with these new tools. We’ll also talk about some of the current limitations of generative AI tools (you’ve seen some of them already in this book!) and offer our thoughts on what may be next.
