# 6 Testing and Prompt Engineering
# 第六章 程序测试与提示词工程

### This chapter covers
### 本章内容概要

* Understanding the importance of testing Copilot code
* Using closed-box versus open-box testing
* Addressing errors by Copilot by modifying prompts
* Viewing examples of testing code produced by Copilot

In Chapter 3, we first started to see the importance of testing the code produced by Copilot. Testing is an essential skill for anyone writing software because it gives you confidence that the code is functioning properly. In this chapter, we’ll learn how to test our code thoroughly and how to help Copilot fix code that doesn’t work by modifying our prompts.

***

* 6.1 Why it is crucial to test code
* 6.2 Closed-box and open-box testing
	* 6.2.1 Closed-box testing
	* 6.2.2 How do we know which test cases to use?
	* 6.2.3 Open-box testing
* 6.3 How to test your code
	* 6.3.1 Testing using the Python prompt
	* 6.3.2 Testing in your Python file (we won’t be doing it this way)
	* 6.3.3 doctest
* 6.4 Revisiting the cycle of designing functions with Copilot
* 6.5 Full testing example
	* 6.5.1 Finding the most students we can add to a row
	* 6.5.2 Improving the prompt to find a better solution
	* 6.5.3 Testing the new solution
* 6.6 Another full testing example—Testing with files
	* 6.6.1 What tests should we run?
	* 6.6.2 Creating the function
	* 6.6.3 Testing the function
