## 3.3 Roles of functions

Functions are used in many different roles in programming. At a high level, programs are really just functions that (often) call other functions. Critically, all programs, including Python programs, originate with a single function (named main in languages like Java, C, and C++). Python’s main function is essentially the first line of code that isn’t in a function. But if every program starts with a single function and we just told you that trying to solve a large problem with a single function is a mistake, how does that work? Well, main will call other functions which, in turn, will call other functions, and so forth. The code will still execute (mostly) sequentially in each function, so it may start in main, but then move to another function, and so forth.

As an example, let’s use the following code. We wrote this code, not Copilot, because no one would ever want to write this code for anything useful outside teaching. It’s just for demonstrating how function calls work.

> Listing 3.1 Python code to demonstrate how Python handles function calls

```python
def funct1():
    print("there")
    funct2()
    print("friend")
    funct3()
    print("")

def funct2():
    print("my")

def funct3():
    print(".")

def funct4():
    print("well")

print("Hi")
funct1()
print("I'm")
funct4()
funct3()
print("")
print("Bye.")
```


If we were to run this program, this would be the output (we’ll explain why below):

```
Hi
there
my
friend
.

I'm
well
.

Bye.
```


In figure 3.2, we are providing a diagram of how the code in listing 3.1 would be executed by the computer. We’ve intentionally provided an example that has many function calls to tie together what we just learned. Again, this is NOT practical code; it’s just for learning purposes. Let’s trace through the code execution together. It may be easier to refer to figure 3.2 than listing 3.1 as you follow along, but either will work.

The program will start execution with the first line in the Python code that isn’t a function ( `print("Hi")` ). Although Python doesn’t have a `main` function per-se, we’ll refer to the block of code after the functions as `main` to help this explanation. Code executes sequentially unless it encounters commands that tell it to execute code somewhere else. So, after executing `print("Hi")`, it will go to the next line which is the call to funct1: `funct1()`. The call to `funct1` changes where the code is executing to the very start of that function which is the statement: `print("there")`. The next line of `funct1` calls `funct2`, so this means the program will execute the first line of `funct2`: `print("my")`. What gets really interesting is what happens when `funct2` finishes. There are no more lines of code to execute, so it automatically moves execution back to the first line following the call to `funct2` in `funct1`. (If the function call is in the middle of another statement, that statement resumes execution, but for this example, the function calls are each on their own line.) If you are curious why it goes to the next line after the call to `funct2` rather than back to the call of `funct2`, the issue is if it returned back to the call to `funct2`, it would be trapped calling `funct2` forever. As a result, functions always return back to the next piece of code to execute (in this example, the next line) after they were called.

Continuing this example, the next line of the code executed will be the line that prints “friend”. The next line calls `funct3`. `funct3` prints a “.” and then returns back to its caller.

So, we’re back in `funct1`, on the line `print("")`. Printing an empty piece of text just causes a new line. Now `funct1` is finished, so it transfers execution back to the next line in `main` after it was called. We suspect you are getting the idea by now, so let’s move a bit more quickly:

* Main next prints “I'm” and then calls `funct4`.

* `funct4` prints “well” and then returns back to `main` where the next line of code calls `funct3`.

* `funct3` prints a “.” and then returns back to `main`. Notice that `funct3` was called both by `funct1` and by `main`, but that’s okay because functions remember how to return back to the function that called them. In fact, having multiple functions calling the same function is a sign that the function being called multiple times is a good function, because of its reuse.

* After `funct3` returns to main, it will print a “” which causes a new line to be started, and then it prints the word “Bye.”

That was a long example, but we provided it to help give you an idea of how functions execute and how programs consist of defining and calling functions. In any software you use, think about the specific tasks that it performs: the programmers probably wrote one or more functions for each one. The button in a text editor that changes the text to bold probably calls a function to change the text to bold. That function might change the editor’s internal idea of the text (the editor likely stores your text in a different format than how you view it) and then it might call another function that updates the user’s (your) view of the text.

We’d also like to use this example to discuss the different roles that functions play. A _helper_ function is a function whose job is to make another functions job easier. In a sense, every function that isn’t “main” is a helper function.

Some functions simply call a bunch of other functions without doing any of their own work. There aren’t any of these in our example. However, if you removed the three print statements from `funct1`, it would become this type of coordinating function. Others may call helper function(s), then do some work on their own. `funct1` is a great example of a function that calls other functions but also does work on its own. And another group of functions stand on their own, without calling other functions (except perhaps functions that already come with Python) for help—we’ll call these functions _leaf_ functions. Why leaf? If you imagine all of the function calls as a big tree, these functions are the leaves of the tree as they have nothing coming out of them. `funct2`, `funct3`, and `funct4` are all leaf functions in our example. We’re primarily concerned with leaf functions in this chapter, but you’ll see examples of other kinds of functions here and especially in later chapters.
