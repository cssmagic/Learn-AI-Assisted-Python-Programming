## 3.1 Functions

Before we can learn about the details of writing a function, we need some insight into their purpose in software. Functions are small tasks that help accomplish larger tasks, which in turn help solve larger tasks, and so forth. We think you already have a lot of intuition about breaking apart large tasks into smaller tasks that you’ll be able to bring to bear in this example:

Suppose that you’ve found a word search puzzle in the newspaper that you’d like to solve (See figure 3.1 for an example puzzle). In these kinds of puzzles, you’re looking for each of the words in the word list. The words can be found going from left to right, right to left, up to down, or down to up.

At a high level, your task is “find all of the words in the word search”. Unfortunately, that description of the task isn’t helpful on its own. It doesn’t tell us what steps we need to carry out to solve the problem.

Try working on the problem right now for a couple minutes. How did you start? How did you break down the overall task to make it more achievable?

One thing you might do is say, “OK, finding every word is a big task, but a smaller task is just finding the first word (CAT). Let me work on that first!” This is an example of taking a large task and breaking it into smaller tasks. To solve the entire puzzle, then, you could repeat that smaller task for each word that you need to find.

Now, how would we find an individual word, such as CAT? Even this task can be broken down further to make it easier to accomplish. For example, we could break it into four tasks: search for CAT from left to right, search for CAT from right to left, search for CAT from top to bottom, and search for CAT bottom to top. Not only are we making simpler and simpler tasks, but we’re also organizing our work into logical pieces. And, most importantly, as we’ll see throughout the chapter, it’s these simpler tasks whose code we’re going to ask Copilot to write and ultimately assemble into our complete programs.

Taking a large problem and dividing it into smaller tasks is called _problem decomposition_ and is one of the most important skills in software design. We’ve dedicated an entire later chapter to it. For now, what is essential is knowing what’s too big of a task to ask Copilot. Asking it to make a new video game that’s a combination of Wordscapes meets Wordle is not going to work at all. However, you can get Copilot to write a function that’s important to solve a larger problem; for example, you might have a function that checks to see if the word provided by the player is present in a list of valid words.

Copilot can solve that problem well and that function would help Copilot get closer to being able to solve the larger problem.

### 3.1.1 The components of a function

The origin of the name “function” goes back to math where functions define the output of something based on an input. For example, if f(x) = x2 we can say that when x is 6, f(x) is 36. As programming functions also have expected output for a particular input, the name is quite apt for programming as well.

As software engineers, we also like to think of functions as promises or contracts. If there is a function called “larger” and we’re told that it takes two numbers and gives us the larger of the two, we have faith that when we give the function the numbers 2 and 5, it will return the answer of 5. We don’t need to see how that function works to be able to use it, any more than we need to know how the mechanics of a car works to be able to use the brake pedal. Press the brake, the car slows down. Give the function two numbers, it gives us back the larger of the two.

Every function in Python has a function header (also called a signature), which is the first line of code of the function. Given their ubiquitous nature, we’ll want to be able to read and write headers. The function header describes the name of the function and its inputs. In some other languages, it sometimes includes some information about what the output looks like, but in Python you have to find that elsewhere in the code.

In Chapter 2, we wrote # comments to tell Copilot what to do. We can continue to use that approach if we want Copilot to generate a function. For example, we can use comments to ask Copilot to write a function that tells us which of two numbers is biggest:

```python
# write a function that returns the larger of two numbers
# input is two numbers
# output is the larger of the two numbers
def larger(num1, num2):
    if num1 > num2:
        return num1
    else:
        return num2
```

As with the code in the last chapter, we just wrote the comments to prompt Copilot to give us the code. The function header has three main components: the keyword that tells Python that this is a function, the name of the function, and the inputs to the function. The word `def` denotes that this is creating (defining) a function. After `def` is the name of the function; that name should describe the behavior of the function as well as possible. The name of this function is `larger`. If it’s hard to name a function because it does a bunch of different things, that’s usually a clue that it’s too big a task for a single function, but more on that later.

What appears in the parentheses are the parameters. Parameters are how you provide information to a function that it needs to run. A function can have any number of parameters and some functions have no parameters. This function has two parameters named `num1` and `num2`; there are two parameters because it needs to know the two numbers it’s comparing.

There can be only one output of a function; the keyword to look for when determining what the function is returning is **return**. Whatever follows the word `return` is the output of the function. In this code, either `num1` or `num2` will be returned. Functions are not required to return anything (e.g., a function that prints a list to the screen has no reason to return anything) so if you don’t see a return statement, it isn’t necessarily a problem as the function may be doing something else (interacting with the user, for example) rather than returning something. Functions also either have to return something or not return something, they can’t return something in some cases and nothing in other cases.

Although we had Copilot generate this function using # comments, this approach is actually a lot of work for Copilot. It first has to get the header right, including figuring out how many parameters you need. Then it has to get the actual code of the function right.

There’s an alternate way to prompt Copilot to write the code for a function that may help it generate code more accurately and may help us better understand exactly what we want our function to do. It involves writing a docstring, and we’ll use docstrings to write functions for the majority of the book.

> **Docstrings explain function behavior**
>
> Docstrings are how Python functions are described by programmers. They follow the function header and begin and end with three quotation marks.

By writing the header and docstring, you’ll make it easier for Copilot to generate the right code. In the header, you will be the one deciding on the name of the function and will provide the names of each parameter that you want the function to use. After the function header, you’ll provide a docstring which tells Copilot what the function does. Then, just as before, Copilot will generate the code for the function. Because we gave Copilot the function header, it will be able to learn from the header and is less likely to make mistakes.

Here’s what the alternate approach would look like when writing that same `larger` function:

```python
def larger(num1, num2):
"""
num1 and num2 are two numbers.

Return the larger of the two numbers.
"""
    if num1 > num2:
        return num1
    else:
        return num2
```

Notice that we wrote the function header as well as the docstring; Copilot supplied the body of the function.

### 3.1.2 Using a function

Once we have a function, how do we use it? Thinking back to our f(x) = x2 analogy, how do we give the function a value of x that is 6 so that it returns to us 36? Let’s see how to do this with code by using that larger function we just wrote.

The way to use a function is to _call_ it. Calling a function means to invoke the function on specific values of parameters. These parameter values are called arguments. Each value in Python has a **type**, and we need to take care to give values of the proper type. For example, that larger function is expecting two numbers; it might not work in the expected way if we supply things that aren’t numbers. When we call a function, it runs its code and returns its result. We need to capture that result so that we can use it later, otherwise it will be lost. To capture a result, we use a _variable_, which is just a name that refers to a value.

Here, we ask Copilot to call the function, store the result in a variable, and then print the result.

```python
# call the larger function with the values 3 and 5
# store the result in a variable called result
# then print result
result = larger(3, 5)
print(result)
```

The code correctly calls larger. Notice that it puts the two values we want compared after the opening parenthesis. When the function finishes, it returns a value that we assign to result. Then we print the result. If you run this program, you’ll see that the output 5 gets produced, and that’s because 5 is the larger of the two values that we asked about.

It’s okay if you aren’t comfortable with all the details here, but what we want you to be able to recognize is when a function is being called, e.g.,

```python
larger(3, 5)
```

The general format for a function call is the following:

```python
function_name(argument1, argument2, argument3, ... )
```

So, when you see those parentheses right after a name, it means there’s a function call. Calling functions as we did here will be important to our workflow with Copilot, particularly in how we test functions to see if they are working properly. We’ll also need to call functions to get work done, as functions don’t do anything until we call them.
