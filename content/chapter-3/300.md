# 3 Designing Functions
# 第三章 设计函数

### This chapter covers
### 本章内容概要

* Functions in Python and their role in designing software
* Reasonable tasks for Copilot to solve
* The standard workflow when interacting with Copilot
* Examples of writing good functions using Copilot

One of the hardest challenges for programming novices is to know what a reasonable task is to give to Copilot so that it finds a good solution. If you give it too big a task, it will often fail in spectacular ways that can be extremely difficult to fix. What, then, is a reasonable task?

This question is important for our use of Copilot but goes far beyond it. Human programmers struggle with complexity, too. If experienced software engineers try to write code to solve a problem that’s too complex without breaking it down into smaller, more solvable subparts, they often have trouble as well. The solution for humans has been to use something called a function, whose job is to perform one task. There are various rules of thumb for how to write a reasonable function in terms of number of lines of code, but fundamentally these rules try to capture writing something that (1) performs a single task and (2) is not so complex that it’s hard to get right.

For students who learned to program the old-fashioned way, without Copilot, they’ll have been struggling with syntax in code that’s 5-10 lines long for about a month before we typically introduce functions and, at that point, it’s a natural segue to tell them not to write more code in a single function than they can handle testing and debugging. As you all are learning to work with Copilot rather than syntax directly, our job in this chapter is to teach you about functions and what are reasonable, and unreasonable, tasks to ask Copilot to solve in a single function.

To help you gain perspective on functions, we’ll provide you with a number

  

of examples in this chapter. For those examples, you’ll see us employ the central workflow of interacting with Copilot; specifically, the cycle of writing prompts, receiving code from Copilot, and testing to see if that code is correct. In the functions produced by Copilot, you’ll begin to see the core programming tools, like loops, conditionals, and lists, that we’ll expand on in the next chapter.
