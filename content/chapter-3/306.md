## 3.6 Examples of creating good functions with Copilot

In this section, we’re going to write a bunch of functions with Copilot. We’ll be coding them entirely in Copilot to help you see the cycle of function design we just described. Although our goal in this chapter isn’t to help you read code just yet, we will be seeing programming features (sometimes called constructs) in the solutions that are very common in code (e.g., if statements, loops) so we’ll point those out when we see them. Then in Chapter 4, we’ll say more about how to read this code in more detail.

Many of the functions we’re about to work on are unrelated to each other. For example, we’ll start with a function about stock share prices and move to functions about strong passwords. You typically wouldn’t store unrelated stuff like this in the same Python file. But as we’re just exploring different examples of good functions, please feel free to store all functions in the same Python file, perhaps named `function_practice.py` or `ch3.py`.

### 3.6.1 Dan’s stock pick

Dan is an investor in a stock called AAAPL. He purchased 10 shares for $15 each. Now, each of those shares is worth $17. Dan would like to know how much money he has made on the stock.

Remember that we want to make our function as general as possible. If the only thing our function could do is calculate this exact AAAPL situation, it wouldn’t be that useful in general. Sure, it would help Dan right now, but what about when AAAPL’s share price changes again, or when he is interested in another stock entirely?

A useful general function here would take three parameters, all of which are numbers. The first parameter is the number of shares purchased, the second is the share price when the shares were purchased, and the third is the current share price. Let’s call this function `money_made`, since it’s going to determine how much money we’ve made or lost on the stock. In general, you want to name your function as an action word or words that describe what your function is doing. With that, we have enough to write the function header:

```python
def money_made(num_shares, purchase_share_price, current_share_price):
```

Now we need a docstring. In the docstring, we need to explain what each parameter is for by using its name in a sentence. We also need to include what the function is supposed to do.

Adding our docstring, here is the full prompt that we provide to Copilot:

```python
def money_made(num_shares, purchase_share_price, current_share_price):
"""
num_shares is the number of shares of a stock that we purchased.
purchase_share_price is the price of each of those shares.
current_share_price is the current share price.
Return the amount of money we have earned on the stock.
"""
```


After typing that prompt, go to the next line and press the tab key. Copilot will fill in the code for the function. Don’t worry that the code gets indented: the code of functions is supposed to be indented, and in fact it’s an error if it isn’t!

Here’s what we got from Copilot:

```python
return num_shares * (current_share_price - purchase_share_price)
```


This code seems sensible. In the parentheses it figures out the difference between the current price and the purchase price (the `-` is used for subtraction), and then it multiplies that by the number of shares that we have (the `*` is used for multiplication). Inspecting code like this is a useful skill, and we’ll get serious about it in the next chapter. Another useful skill is testing the function.

To test the function, we call it using various inputs and observe the output in each case. We could do this by asking Copilot to call the function and then running our program, much as we did with our “larger” function. We could then ask Copilot to change the function call by asking it to call the function with a different input, and run our program again, repeating as many times as needed.

However, we find it easier and more convenient to call the function ourselves from an interactive window.

This way, we can call the function as many times as we like without going through Copilot at all, and without cluttering up our program with stuff we’re going to delete anyway. To try this interactive approach, select/highlight all of the code of the function, then press `<Shift>+Enter` (you can access a similar interactive session by selecting the text, right-clicking, and choosing Run Selection/Line in Python Window, but the guidance here is if you use `<Shift>+Enter`). Figure 3.4 shows what this looks like if you select the text of the function and press `<Shift>+Enter`.

> Figure 3.4 Running Python in an interactive session in the Terminal of VSCode. Note the \>>> at the bottom of the Terminal.


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cssmagic/Learn-AI-Assisted-Python-Programming/master/content/_figures/3.4.png)

At the bottom of the resulting window, you will see three greater-than symbols >>>. This is called a _prompt_, and you’re allowed to type Python code here. (This _prompt_ has nothing to do with the kind of prompt that we use when interacting with Copilot.) It will show us the result of the code that we type right away, which is convenient and fast.

To call our `money_made` function, we need to provide three arguments, and they will be assigned left to right to the parameters. Whatever we put first will be assigned to `num_shares`, whatever we put second will be assigned to `purchase_share_price`, and whatever we put third will be assigned to `current_share_price`.

Let’s try this! At the prompt, type the following and press enter (or `<shift>+Enter`). Don’t type the >>> as that’s already there, and we are including it throughout the book to make it clear where we are typing. Please see figure 3.5 for an example of running the function in the terminal at the Python prompt.

```
>>> money_made(10, 15, 17)
```

You’ll see an output of

```
20
```


Is `20` correct? Well, we bought 10 shares, and each of them went up $2 (from $15 to $17), so we did make $20. Looks good!

We’re not done testing, though. When testing a function, you want to test it in various ways, not just once. All one test case tells you is that it happened to work with the particular input values that you provided. The more test cases we try, each testing the function in a different way, the more confident we are that our function is correct.

How do we test this function in a different way? We’re looking for inputs that are somehow a different _category_ of input. One not-so-good test right now would be to say, “what if our stock went from $15 to $18, instead of $15 to $17?”. This is pretty much the same test as before, and chances are that it will work just fine.

A good idea is to test what happens when the stock actually _loses money_. We expect to get a negative return value in this case. And it appears that our function works just fine with this category of test. Here’s our function call and the output that is returned to us:

```
>>> money_made(10, 17, 15)
-20
```

What other tests can we do? Well, sometimes a stock price doesn’t change at all. We expect 0 in this case. Let’s verify it:

```
>>> money_made(10, 15, 15)
0
```

Looks good!

Testing is a combination of science and art. How many categories of things are there to test? Are these two calls really two different categories? Have we missed any categories? You will improve your testing ability through practice, and we’ll spend all of Chapter 6 talking about testing. For now, it looks like our `money_made` function is doing its job.

It’s possible for a function to use variables (rather than just its parameters) in its code, and we want to show you an example of that now so that you’re ready when you see Copilot doing it.

Here’s an equivalent way to write the code for our `money_made` function:

```python
price_difference = current_share_price - purchase_share_price
   return num_shares * price_difference
```

This may even be easier to read for you: first it figures out the difference in share price, and then it multiplies that by the number of shares. We encourage you to test this version to help convince yourself that it is still correct.

### 3.6.2 Leo’s password

Leo is signing up for a new social network website called ProgrammerBook. He wants to make sure that his password is strong.

Leo starts with a modest definition of what it means for a password to be strong: it’s strong if it’s not the word ‘password’ and not the word ‘qwerty.’ (Those are terrible passwords, for sure, but in reality, we have to do way better than this definition to ensure that our password is strong!)

A helpful function would be one that takes a proposed password and tells us whether it is strong or not.

Unlike our previous functions in this chapter, we’re not dealing with numbers here. The parameter, the password to check, is text. And the return value is supposed to indicate some yes/no result. We need new types!

The Python type for text is called a **string**. There are zillions of possible strings, because we can use a string to store whatever text we want. And the Python type for a yes/no result is called a **Boolean** or **bool**. A bool has only two values: True or False.

Alright! We’re ready to prompt Copilot. For functions that return bool (True/False) values, we usually name the function as `has_x`, or `is_x`, or using some other verb that implies a true/false result.

```python
def is_strong_password(password):
"""
A strong password is not the word 'password'
and is not the word 'qwerty'.

Return True if the password is a strong password, False if not.
"""
```


In response, here’s what Copilot wrote for us:

```python
return password != 'password' and password != 'qwerty'
```

Look over that code for a moment. That `!=` operator is the ‘not equal’ operator, and each string that doesn’t count as a strong password is in single quotation marks. We’re going to use quotation marks every time we work with a string value. Again, we’ll talk more about how to read code in the next chapter, but for now we hope that the code makes a fuzzy sort of sense: it looks like it’s checking that the password isn’t `password` and isn’t `qwerty`, which matches our definition of a strong password.

Now let’s make sure that this function does indeed work, by making a few test calls.

We’ll start by testing the passwords that are not strong. We had better get back `False` for each of these—and we do!

```
>>> is_strong_password('password')
False

>>> is_strong_password('qwerty')
False
```


Good! Now, let’s try a strong password. We need to see True here:

```
>>> is_strong_password('N3w Y0rk J375')
True
```


Good stuff! We now see that the function sometimes returns False and other times returns True, so at least it’s not always returning False.

Let’s try one more:

```
>>> is_strong_password('Leo')
True
```

Well, technically True is correct, but wow is ‘Leo’ a bad password. We should really have done better with our definition of a strong password. Let’s change our prompt to give a more reasonable definition of what it means for a password to be strong.

Here's our next prompt and what Copilot gave us.

```python
def is_strong_password(password):
"""
A strong password has at least one uppercase character,
at least one number, and at least one special symbol.

Return True if the password is a strong password, False if not.
"""
    return any(char.isupper() for char in password) and \
             any(char.isdigit() for char in password) and \
             any(not char.isalnum() for char in password)
```

That `for char in password` that shows up a few times here is a way for Python to consider each character of the password. It enables something called a loop, which is a key topic that we’ll study in Chapter 5.

It’s of course possible that you didn’t get the same code from Copilot as we did. But based on the code that we got, it looks like the first piece is looking for any uppercase character, the second piece is looking for any digit, and the third is looking for something that's not an `isalnum`.

Maybe isalnum means ‘is alphanumeric’. Does that include special symbols and, if so, which ones?

Let's test this function to see how well we’re doing.

```
>>> is_strong_password('Leo')
False

>>> is_strong_password('N3w Y0rk J37$')
True

>>> is_strong_password('N3w Y0rk J375')
True
```

Uh oh—we got the wrong answer for that third password. It looks pretty strong, but it's not, because it lacks a special symbol. Our function returned `True`, but that’s the wrong return value: it was supposed to return `False`.

The code that Copilot gave us is wrong. Maybe the code that you got worked fine, but we didn’t get so lucky and it’s important we know how to identify (like we just did) when the code is wrong and then fix it. It’s not important to know why it’s wrong right now, but if you are curious about why our prompt may have given us the wrong behavior, we didn’t specify what we meant by a special character and the code it gave us counts spaces as special characters.

At this point, with our wrong code, we have two options. One option is to hit `<Ctrl>+Enter` and look through the other suggestions that Copilot gives us. Maybe one of those suggestions will have something to do with special symbols that looks different from the one that didn't work?

Indeed, on our computer here, we see such options, including this one:

```python
num_upper = 0
    num_num = 0
    num_special = 0
    for char in password:
        if char.isupper():
            num_upper += 1
        elif char.isnumeric():
            num_num += 1
        elif char in '!@#$%^&*':
            num_special += 1
    if num_upper >= 1 and num_num >= 1 and num_special >= 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```


Test this function with strings like `Leo` and `N3w Y0rk J375` and `N3w Y0rk J375$` and you should see that the function works well.

Our second option is to do some prompt engineering, which means adjusting our prompt to influence what Copilot gives us.

In our original prompt, we talked about "special symbols". This, in retrospect, is pretty vague. We probably meant something more specific, like "punctuation". If we specifically talk about punctuation in our prompt, we get this interaction with Copilot:

```python
def is_strong_password(password):
"""
A strong password has at least one uppercase character,
at least one number, and at least one punctuation.

Return True if the password is a strong password, False if not.
"""
    return any(char.isupper() for char in password) and \
           any(char.isdigit() for char in password) and \
           any(char in string.punctuation for char in password)
```

Looks good... that last line is talking about 'punctuation', which is hopeful. Let's test:

```
>>> is_strong_password('Leo')
False

>>> is_strong_password('N3w Y0rk J375')
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
 File "ch2.py", line 44, in is_strong_password
   any(char in string.punctuation for char in password)
 File "ch2.py", line 44, in <genexpr>
   any(char in string.punctuation for char in password)
               ^^^^^^
NameError: name 'string' is not defined
```


Look at the bottom of that error message, `'string'` is not defined, eh? We’re running into an issue that’s similar to what we saw in Chapter 2 with modules. Copilot wants to use a module, called `string`, but it is a module that needs to be imported before we can use it. There are a lot of modules in Python, but the `string` module is pretty well known. As you work with Copilot more, you’ll learn which modules are commonly used so you know to import them. You could also do a quick internet search to ask, “is string a Python module” and the results would confirm that it is. What we need to do is import the module.

Note that this is different, somewhat, from what we encountered in Chapter 2\. In Chapter 2, we saw what happens when the code from Copilot imports modules we didn’t have installed, and we had to install the package containing those modules to fix the issue. In this case, the code from Copilot is using a module that already happens to be installed with Python, but it forgot to import it. So, we don’t need to install string; we just have to import it.

> **Importing Modules**
>
> There are a number of useful modules available in Python. We saw how powerful matplotlib is in Chapter 2. But in order for Python code to take advantage of modules, we have to import that module. You might ask why don’t we just have modules available to us without importing them, but that would massively increase the complexity of the code and what Python has to do to run code behind the scenes. Instead, the model is to include modules if you want to use them, and they aren’t included by default.

Let's `import string` at the top of our code:


```python
import string

def is_strong_password(password):
"""
A strong password has at least one uppercase character,
at least one number, and at least one punctuation.

Return True if the password is a strong password, False if not.
"""
    return any(char.isupper() for char in password) and \
           any(char.isdigit() for char in password) and \
           any(char in string.punctuation for char in password)
```


Now we're in good shape:

```
>>> is_strong_password('Leo')
False

>>> is_strong_password('N3w Y0rk J375')
False

>>> is_strong_password('N3w Y0rk J375$')
True
```

That last one is `True`—-it's a strong password!—because it has the `$` punctuation added to it.

We hope that you're now convinced of the value of testing! Sometimes our students don’t test their code. They assume that the code they write is correct because it made sense to them. An interesting difference between novice and experienced programmers is that novices often assume their code is right, whereas experience programmers assume the code is wrong until thoroughly tested and proved otherwise. Beyond this, we find that our students sometimes fail to test well because it's disheartening to learn that the code is wrong. But it's better to know now, rather than later when others are using your code in a serious application. Finding errors through testing is actually a good thing.

### 3.6.3 Getting a strong password

Now that we have a function that tells us whether a password is strong or not, let’s write a function that obtains a strong password from the user. It will ask again and again for a password until the user types a strong one. This is the kind of code that websites use when they tell you, “Sorry, your password is too weak, try again.”

What should the header for such a function look like? Well, it’s going to ask the user for a password, so we won’t have a password parameter. In fact, we won’t have any parameters at all, because the function doesn’t need any information to do its job – it just has to prompt the user and the user is going to type the password at the keyboard. When the function has done its work, it will return the strong password, so it will continue to return a string as the output.

Let’s try this prompt:

```python
def get_strong_password():
"""
Keep asking the user for a password until it is a strong
password, and return that strong password.
"""
```

We got the following code from Copilot as a result:

```python
password = input("Enter a strong password: ")
    while not is_strong_password(password):
        password = input("Enter a strong password: ")
    return password
```


That `while` keyword creates another kind of loop, this one continuing as long as the entered password is not strong. Copilot is also smart enough to call our earlier `is_strong_password` function to determine what counts as a strong password. As we will see in future chapters, using functions as building blocks in this way is precisely how large programs are built. You will often notice Copilot calling your earlier functions to solve later ones, much as we observed here.

Let’s test this! Highlight all of our password function code and hit `<Shift>+Enter`. We’ll call the function that we want to test. Then, try typing passwords, hitting enter after each one. You’ll notice that it keeps asking you until you finally provide a strong password:

```python
>>> get_strong_password()
Enter a strong password: Leo
Enter a strong password: N3w Y0rk J375
Enter a strong password: N3w Y0rk J375$
'N3w Y0rk J375$'
```

Notice that it stops asking us for a password when we finally provide a strong password. Then, we see the string in quotes that it returned, which is indeed our strong password.

### 3.6.4 Scrabble scoring

One of Dan’s favorite board games is Scrabble. Have you played it? If not, all you need to know is that you have some tiles in your hand, each with a letter on it, and your goal is to form a word using any combination of those letters. You don’t need to form the word exclusively with your tiles – you can attach those letters to existing letters on the board to create longer words – but we’re not going to worry about that here. The important thing for us is that different letters are worth different numbers of points. For example, an ‘a’ is worth only one point, because ‘a’ is such a common letter. But ‘q’? ‘z’? Those doozies are each worth ten points, because they’re so tough to use. … or should we say ‘puzzling’ to use. Yeah, that’s better.

To calculate the score for a word, we add up the scores for each of its letters. For example, the score for ‘zap’ would be 14. That’s because z is worth 10, a is worth 1, and p is worth 3.

Dan would like a function that, given a word, tells him how many points that word is worth. OK, so we need a function that takes a word (which is just one parameter). That’s just one parameter. Let’s try this prompt, where we’ve included the number of points that each letter is worth per official Scrabble rules:


```python
def num_points(word):
"""
Each letter is worth the following points:
a, e, i, o, u, l, n, s, t, r: 1 point
d, g: 2 points
b, c, m, p: 3 points
f, h, v, w, y: 4 points
k: 5 points
j, x: 8 points
q, z: 10 points

word is a word consisting of lowercase characters.
Return the sum of points for each letter in word.
"""
```

For this function, Copilot isn’t filling in the whole body for us with one press of the tab key. Tab is also used to indent the code, which we also need to do here before Copilot will present us with code. So, we’re having to press tab (sometimes once for the indentation, then again for Copilot), wait for the code to appear, then press enter to accept that code, then press tab again for more code, and repeat the process.

> **Getting Copilot to suggest code may require pressing `<Tab>` or `<Enter>`**
>
> We find that Copilot will sometimes pause in giving suggestions until you press a key to help prompt it. As mentioned in table 2.1, if you are giving it comments, it will sometimes just want to give you more comments as suggestions. Pressing Enter another time can often trigger it to start generating code instead. Other times, pressing tab will cause it to continue providing suggestions. Please refer back to table 2.1 if Copilot is not generating code for you.

Finally, after doing that a few times, the entire code unfurls, and we get the following:

```python
points = 0
   for char in word:
       if char in "aeioulnstr":
           points += 1
       elif char in "dg":
           points += 2
       elif char in "bcmp":
           points += 3
       elif char in "fhvwy":
           points += 4
       elif char == "k":
           points += 5
       elif char in "jx":
           points += 8
       elif char in "qz":
           points += 10
   return points
```


Notice how all of the letters of the alphabet are accounted for here, and the number of points that each category is worth is on the following line. We’ll discuss this overall kind of decision structure in the next chapter, but, at a high level, it is walking through the word character by character and for each character, figuring out which letter it is and adding the appropriate number of points for that letter.

Let’s test this to make sure our code is performing the way we want. We know that the word ‘zap’ should be worth 14 points. And it is:

```
>>> num_points('zap')
14
```

Let’s try a couple more. In each case, calculate by hand what you expect the answer to be – that way you’ll know if the code is doing the right thing.

```
>>> num_points('pack')
12

>>> num_points('quack')
20
```

There are many ways to write correct code for a function. If you press `<Ctrl>+Enter` and look at the Copilot suggestions, you may see different types of code. It doesn’t necessarily mean that one of these types is right and the others are wrong.

For example, here’s another solution for `num_points` that we got from the other Copilot suggestions.

```python
points = {'a': 1, 'e': 1, 'i': 1, 'o': 1, 'u': 1, 'l': 1,
             'n': 1, 's': 1, 't': 1, 'r': 1,
             'd': 2, 'g': 2,
             'b': 3, 'c': 3, 'm': 3, 'p': 3,
             'f': 4, 'h': 4, 'v': 4, 'w': 4, 'y': 4,
             'k': 5,
             'j': 8, 'x': 8,
             'q': 10, 'z': 10}
   return sum(points[char] for char in word)
```

Notice here that each letter is listed individually along with its number of points. This structure with the letters and points is called a dictionary and, again, we’ll learn about dictionaries properly in a later chapter. The point for now is just that there are often multiple, equivalently good ways for Copilot to write the code for a function. Give this one a try with some test cases before you continue!

### 3.6.5 The best word

Let’s continue with the Scrabble theme. Suppose that Dan has a bunch of words that he can make right now, but he doesn’t know which one will give him the most points. Should he make the word ‘zap’? ‘pack’? ‘quack’? It would be nice if we had a function that could take a bunch of words and tell us which is the best one.

How many parameters should we have in such a function? Your first instinct may be 3, one for each of the 3 words in our options. But that wouldn’t be very flexible. After all, what if we want to know the best of five words? Ten words? Fifty? We would like our function to work, no matter how many words we are considering.

The trick is to use a function with one (yes, just one!) parameter, which is a _list_ of words. Just like numbers and strings and dictionaries, a list is a type supported by Python. It’s incredibly useful because it allows us to collect as many values into one place as we like.

We can prompt Copilot like this to get the function that we want:

```python
def best_word(word_list):
"""
word_list is a list of words.

Return the word worth the most points.
"""
```


How will Copilot know how many points each word is worth? Well, it can call that `num_points` function that we wrote in the previous section!

Here’s the code that Copilot gives us.

```python
best_word = ""
   best_points = 0
   for word in word_list:
       points = num_points(word)
       if points > best_points:
           best_word = word
           best_points = points
   return best_word
```

We need to be careful to call this function correctly when testing. This won’t work:

```
>>> best_word('zap', 'pack', 'quack')
```

Because that’s passing values for three parameters, not one. The right way to call it is to put the words inside square brackets, like this (we’ll see more about lists in the next chapter):

```
>>> best_word(['zap', 'pack', 'quack'])
'quack'
```


But, as usual, you shouldn’t be content with just one test case. This function should work in other valid but perhaps strange cases, too, such as when we have only one word in the list:

```
>>> best_word(['zap'])
'zap'
```

However, we wouldn’t test this function on a list that has no words in it. What would it even make sense to do in that case? Regardless of what the function does, it’d be hard to say one way or the other whether it was doing the correct thing in a situation where there really is no correct behavior!

Overall, in this chapter we’ve learned about functions in Python and how we can use Copilot to help us write them. We’ve also learned about the characteristics of good functions and how important it is to make sure our functions are solving tasks that can be managed well by Copilot. Our next steps in this book all revolve around understanding if the code produced by Copilot is correct and how to fix it when it isn’t. In the next chapter, we’ll start by learning the basics of being able to read the code produced by Copilot as this gives us the first sanity check for whether Copilot is doing what we think it should be. Then in later chapters we’ll dig deeper into how to carefully test the code and what to do when it is wrong.
