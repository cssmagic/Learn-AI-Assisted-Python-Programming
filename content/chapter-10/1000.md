# 10 Making Some Games
# 第十章 开发小游戏

### This chapter covers
### 本章内容概要

* Adding randomness to our programs
* Designing and programming a code-breaking logic game
* Designing and programming a press-your-luck dice game

There are many reasons why people learn to program. Some people want to automate tedious tasks as we did in the previous chapter. Some people want to work with artificial intelligence as we did in Chapter 7. Other people want to make interactive websites, Android or iOS apps, or Alexa skills. There’s an endless amount of stuff that programmers can make.

Another popular reason to learn programming is to create games. For that reason, we thought we’d end our Copilot programming journey with you by designing two small computer games. The first is a code-breaking game where you use clues to identify the computer’s secret number. The second is a two-player dice game where each player needs to balance risk and luck to reach the required number of points before the other player does. Instead of using graphics and animation, these games use text. We’ve made this decision to help us stay focused on the game logic, rather than the way that the game is represented or the way that the player interacts with the games. Along the way, we offer some next steps if you are interested in taking your game-making abilities further. And don’t worry, your current skills are a great start to that!
