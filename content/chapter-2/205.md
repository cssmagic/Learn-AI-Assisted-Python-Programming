## 2.5 Our first programming problem

The goal of this next section is twofold: 1) for you to see the workflow of interacting with Copilot and 2) for you to gain an appreciation of how powerful Copilot can be by seeing it solve a fairly complicated task fairly easily.

In our next chapter, we’ll talk through the workflow with Copilot in more detail, but generally speaking, you’ll use the following steps when authoring code with Copilot:

1. Write a prompt to Copilot using comments (`#`) or docstrings (`"""`).

2. Let Copilot generate code for you

3. Check to see if the code is correct, by reading through it and by testing

	1. If it works, move to Step #1 for the next thing you’d like it to do.
	1. If it doesn’t work, delete the code from Copilot and go back to Step #1 and modify the prompt (and see suggestions in table 2.1).

Because you’ve just started working with Copilot, we’re wary of showing you such a large example, but we feel you’ll really value seeing how powerful Copilot can be now that you have it installed. **As such, we want you to follow along as best as you can to get a feel for working with Copilot on your own, but if you get stuck, feel free to just read along and save working along with Copilot in VSCode for the next chapter.** Later chapters will explain the process of working with Copilot in more detail.

Also, Copilot will generate a lot of code in this section and we don’t expect you to understand the code until much later in the book. We provide the code solely so you can see what Copilot gave us, but do NOT feel as though you need to try to understand the code in this chapter.

To get started, let’s create a new file. If you aren’t already in VSCode, go ahead and start it. Then create a new Python file and save it as `nfl_stats`.

#### Showcasing Copilot’s value in a data processing Task

We want to start with some basic data processing as this is something that many of you have likely done in your personal or professional lives. To find a dataset, we went to a great website called Kaggle \[4\] which has tons of datasets freely available for use. Many of them include important data like health statistics for different countries, or information to help track the spread of disease, and so on. We’re not going to use those because we’d like to have something lighter for our first program. Since both of us are American Football fans, we felt we should play with the NFL offensive stats database.

Let’s get started by downloading the dataset from:

[www.kaggle.com/datasets/dtrade84/nfl-offensive-stats-2019-2022](http://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dtrade84/nfl-offensive-stats-2019-2022)

To download the dataset, you will have to sign up for a Kaggle account. If you don’t want to create the account, it’s okay to just read through this section without using VSCode and Copilot to generate the code yourself. Once downloaded, you may need to extract the zip file using the default zip extractor on your computer. Copy the dataset file from that zip file into your current folder in VSCode where you have your code (the folder you have open in Explorer). (If you are on a Mac and the file is saved as a .numbers file, you will need to use “File->Export To” to then save the file as a CSV in your current working directory.) That dataset has NFL information from 2019 to 2022.

> Figure 2.4 The first few columns and rows of the `nfl_offensive_stats.csv` dataset.

![](chapter-2.files/chapter-223774.png) 


The `nfl_offensive_stats.csv` file is something known as a comma separated value text file (see figure 2.4 for a portion of the file). This is a pretty standard format for storing data. It has a header row at the top that explains what’s in every column. The way that we (or a computer) know the boundaries between columns is to use the commas between cells. Also notice that each row is placed on its own line.

Good news: Python has a bunch of tools for reading in CSV files.


#### Step 1: How many passing yards did Aaron Rodgers throw in 2019-2022

Let’s start by exploring what is stored in this file. To preview what is in the file, you can look at the Kaggle webpage for these stats under “Detail”, you can open it in VSCode, or you can just open it up in spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel. (If you open it with Excel, be sure not to save the file. We need to leave the file in a `.csv` format.) Whichever way you choose to open it, here’s the start of the header (top) row (also shown in figure 2.4):

```
game_id,player_id,position ,player,team,pass_cmp,pass_att,pass_yds,...
```


There are a bunch more columns after these, but these have all we need to perform our first task. We know now that there’s a column for players and a column for passing yards. Aaron Rodgers is a player that gets passing yards in each game that he plays. But how many passing yards does he have in total, over all of the games that he played? This isn’t so easy to answer by directly looking at the file. So what we want the computer to do is to make this easier for us!

We want it to sum up all the passing yards (pass_yds) for rows (games) where Aaron Rodgers is the player. For now, we’re going to just ask for all the yards in the database even though it covers multiple seasons. We could change this later if we’d like. This problem might be a good problem to give to programmers learning to program in their 4th week of a standard college-level introductory programming course, but we have Copilot! So instead of learning how to write this code from scratch, we’re just going to ask Copilot to generate it for us. To make that happen, we are going to be quite specific in our request to make sure Copilot knows what we are asking for.

Specifically, we’re only going to ask it to perform small amounts of work and then re-prompt it to perform the next step. Later we’ll discuss how to write good prompts, but for now, just go ahead and use what we’ve written below by placing this text at the top of your new file:

```python
""" 
open the csv file called "nfl_offensive_stats.csv" and read in
the csv data from the file
"""
```

The `"""` at the top and the bottom are surrounding something called a docstring. Docstrings are an alternative way of commenting (similar to text starting with `#`). They are commonly used for describing functions (see Chapter 3 for details on functions), but we use them in this example to avoid Copilot continually generating comments (see the “Comments only” problem in table 2.1). Given this prompt, Copilot should start generating code. For us, it produced this block of code:

```python
import csv
with open('nfl_offensive_stats.csv', 'r') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    nfl_data = list(reader)
```

First, for the purpose of reading this book, we want to remind you that the prompt is displayed differently than what Copilot produces. This is intentional so you can tell what we wrote (and you should write) and what Copilot wrote.

Second, the code produced by Copilot is quite reasonable. We don’t expect you to be able to understand the code at this point in the book, but you can likely see the name of the file we wanted opened and some code about opening the file and reading in the file. Later in the book, we’ll learn how to read through the code. For now, just keep following along.

Now that we have the data from the file, we’re going to give it a new prompt to ask it to sum all the passing yards for Aaron Rodgers in this dataset.

Because the computer doesn’t know what football is or specifics like that Aaron Rodgers is a quarterback, our prompt is going to be quite specific. We’ll teach you how to write prompts like this over the course of the book. Here is the new prompt:

```python
""" 
In the data we just read in, the fourth column is the player
and the 8th column is the passing yards. Get the sum of 
yards from column 8 where the 4th column value is
"Aaron Rodgers"
"""
```

Notice how we tell the computer which columns are for players, and which are for passing yards. That’s to tell the computer how to interpret the data. Also, notice how we say specifically that we only want to sum the yards in the case that the player’s name is Aaron Rodgers. Again, we’ll teach you how to write prompts like this as we move forward in the book. Given this prompt, Copilot then produced the code below.

```python
passing_yards = 0
for row in nfl_data:
   if row[3] == 'Aaron Rodgers':
       passing_yards += int(row[7])
print(passing_yards)
```

> **Reminder: Copilot is non-deterministic**
>
> Remember from Chapter 1 that Copilot is nondeterministic so what Copilot gives you may not match what it gives us. This is going to be a challenge for the rest of the book: what do you do if you get a wrong result when we get a right result? We’re actually fairly confident that Copilot will give you a correct answer here, but **if you get a wrong answer from Copilot, go ahead and just read the remainder of this section rather than working along with Copilot in VSCode**. We will absolutely give you all the tools you need to fix the code when Copilot gives you a wrong answer, but that skill will be taught over the remainder of the book, so we don’t want you to get stuck on this now. When we run this code (recall how to “Run Code” from figure 2.1), we get this result: 13852

Which is the correct answer. (We double-checked the answer, but if you are familiar with football, you can likely use estimates to see if the figure seems reasonable. Quarterbacks throw for 3,000-5,500 yards per season, and this is three seasons worth of data, so 13,852 seems like the right ballpark for a high performing quarterback.) What’s particularly interesting is that we planned on giving Copilot a third prompt to ask it to print the result, but Copilot guessed that’s what we’d want to do so it did so on its own.

What do we want you to take from this example (and the rest of the chapter)?

1. **Copilot is a powerful tool.** We didn’t write any code, but we were able to get Copilot to generate the code needed to perform a basic analysis of the data. For readers who have used spreadsheets, you can probably think of a way to do this using spreadsheet applications like Excel, but it likely wouldn’t be as easy as writing code like this. Even if you haven’t used spreadsheets before, you’ve got to admit that it’s amazing that writing some basic, human-readable prompts can produce correct code and output like this.

2. **Breaking problems into small tasks is important.** For this example, we tried writing this code with just a single large prompt (not shown) or by breaking it into two smaller tasks. The larger prompt was almost identical text, just as a single prompt. What we found was that Copilot would usually give us the right answer with the larger prompt but would sometimes make mistakes. This was especially true in the next example we’ll show you. However, breaking the problem into smaller tasks significantly increased the likelihood of Copilot generating the right code. We’ll see how to break down larger problems into smaller tasks throughout the remainder of this book as this is one of the most important skills you’ll need. In fact, the next chapter helps you start understanding what are reasonable tasks to give to Copilot.

3. **We still need to understand code to some degree.** This is true for several reasons. One is that writing good prompts requires you to have a basic understanding of what computers know and what they don’t. We can’t just give a prompt to Copilot that says, “Give me the number of passing yards for Aaron Rodgers.” Copilot likely wouldn’t be able to figure out where the data is stored, the format of the data, which columns correspond to players and passing yards, or that Aaron Rodgers is a player. We had to spell that out to Copilot for it to be successful. Another reason has to do with determining whether code from Copilot is reasonable. When the two of us read the response from Copilot, we know how to read code so we can determine if the code produced by Copilot is reasonable. You’ll need to be able to do this to some degree, which is why Chapters 4 and 5 are dedicated to reading code.

4. **Testing is important.** When programmers talk about testing, they’re referring to the practice of making sure that their code works correctly, even in possibly unexpected circumstances. We didn’t spend much time on this piece other than checking if Copilot’s answer is plausible using estimates on just one data set, but in general we’ll need to spend more time on testing as this is a critical part of the code writing process. It likely goes without saying, but errors in code range from embarrassing (if you tell your hard-core NFL fan friend the wrong number of passing yards for a player) to dangerous (if software in a car behaves incorrectly) to costly (if businesses make decisions on wrong analyses). Concerningly, even after you’ve learned how to read code, we have first-hand experience to tell you that even if the code looks correct, it might not be! To address this, we have to test every piece of code created by Copilot to ensure it does what it should. We’ll learn how to rigorously test Copilot’s code in later chapters.

To showcase the power of Copilot, we’re going to continue this example. Please feel free to follow along writing the prompts and running the code in Copilot or just reading along.

#### Step 2: How well did all the quarterbacks do over that time period?

Knowing how well Aaron Rodgers did is interesting. But a next and more meaningful step would be to compare his stats to other quarterbacks over that time period. We really only want to compare against other quarterbacks because they are the players whose job is to throw the ball. Sure, a running back might throw the ball once a season, and it’s often fun when they do, but it’s not really their job. To include only the quarterbacks, we need to go back to the data for a moment. The third column is for “position” and “QB” stands for Quarterback. As such, let’s delete all the code Copilot gave us (everything after the end of our initial comments) and start over. We won’t show each step like we did above, instead, here is the result of the entire interaction with Copilot with our prompts highlighted as separate from the code it gave us.

> Listing 2.1 Copilot’s code to analyze the top Quarterbacks

```python
"""
open the csv file called "nfl_offensive_stats.csv" and
read in the csv data from the file
"""
# import the csv module
import csv
# open the csv file
with open('nfl_offensive_stats.csv', 'r') as f:
    # read the csv data
    data = list(csv.reader(f))
"""
the 3rd column in data is player position, the fourth column
is the player, and the 8th column is the passing yards.
For each player whose position in column 3 is "QB",
determine the sum of yards from column 8
"""
# create a dictionary to hold the player name and passing yards
passing_yards = {}
# loop through the data
for row in data:
    # check if the player is a quarterback
    if row[2] == 'QB':
        # check if the player is already in the dictionary
        if row[3] in passing_yards:
            # add the passing yards to the existing value
            passing_yards[row[3]] += int(row[7])
        else:
            # add the player to the dictionary
            passing_yards[row[3]] = int(row[7])
"""
print the sum of the passing yards sorted by sum
of passing yards in descending order
"""
for player in sorted(passing_yards, key=passing_yards.get, reverse=True):
    print(player, passing_yards[player])
```

Notice that we gave Copilot three prompts. The first was to handle the input data, the second was to process the data, and the third was to output the response. This cycle of input data, process data, provide output is exceptionally common in programming tasks.

Looking at the results from Copilot, we have to point out that we’ve taught programming for years and this is pretty impressive. We might ask students to solve something like this on a final exam in our college-level classes and we suspect less than half the class would do it correctly. Without diving into too many details, Copilot chose a good way of storing the data by using a dictionary (not a normal dictionary like an English dictionary, but a way of storing data in Python) which is a good choice here and used a clever way of sorting the data to help in displaying the results.

Thinking of the results, here are the first 5 lines from the output if you run the code:

```
Patrick Mahomes 16132
Tom Brady 15876
Aaron Rodgers 13852
Josh Allen 13758
Derek Carr 13271
```

If you follow football, these results should not be a surprise to you. Just to see how well Copilot can adapt to our wishes, let’s try to make a minor change.

Suppose that because Tom Brady is already recognized as one of the best QBs of all time, you would rather omit him from this comparison.

To make this change, we’re just going to modify the prompt at the bottom. Go to the point in the code where it says:

```python
"""
print the sum of the passing yards sorted by sum
of passing yards in descending order 
"""
for player in sorted(passing_yards, key=passing_yards.get, reverse=True):
    print(player, passing_yards[player])
```

Delete the code, just leaving the comment, and add another line to the docstring like this:

```python
"""
print the sum of the passing yards sorted by sum
of passing yards in descending order 
Do not include Tom Brady because he wins too much
"""
```

Copilot then suggested to us:

```python
for player in sorted(passing_yards, key=passing_yards.get, reverse=True):
    if player != "Tom Brady":
        print(player, passing_yards[player])
```

That’s exactly what we’d like to see changed in the code. (Thanks, Tom Brady, for being a good sport in this example.) The code excluded all data for Tom Brady at the point of printing the results. When we save the file and run it again, the first 5 lines are now:

```
Patrick Mahomes 16132
Aaron Rodgers 13852
Josh Allen 13758
Derek Carr 13271
Matt Ryan 13015
```

#### Step 3: Let’s Plot these stats, so we can compare them better

Let’s really drive home our key point that Copilot is a powerful tool by asking it to go even one step farther. The printout of all the quarterback stats is likely a useful analysis for some purposes. But a visual plot might be a better way of presenting this information. Can we ask Copilot to plot it?

Suppose we just care about the top performing quarterbacks, and so we decide to set an arbitrary limit of 4,000 yards as the minimum number of yards a quarterback needs to throw during this time window to be included in our plot. Granted, asking Copilot to plot the data is likely to introduce some new challenges because it will involve going beyond straight text, but let’s give it a try.

At the end of the code we just wrote, add the following comment:

```python
"""
plot the players by their number of passing yards only for 
players with more than 4000 passing yards
"""
```

When we gave Copilot this prompt, here is the code it gave us:

> Listing 2.2 Code given by Copilot to plot our data about quarterbacks.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
# create a list of players
players = []
# create a list of passing yards
yards = []
# for each player in the dictionary
for player in passing_yards:
   # if the player has more than 4000 passing yards
   if passing_yards[player] > 4000:
       # add the player to the list of players
       players.append(player)
       # add the passing yards to the list of passing yards
       yards.append(passing_yards[player])
# create a numpy array of the passing yards
yards = np.array(yards)
# create a numpy array of the players
players = np.array(players)
# sort the players by the passing yards
print(np.argsort(yards))
players = players[np.argsort(yards)]
# sort the passing yards
yards = np.sort(yards)
# create a figure
plt.figure()
# create a bar chart of the players and their passing yards
plt.bar(players, yards)
# rotate the x axis labels
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
# show the plot
plt.show()
```

We gave Copilot this prompt a number of times and it would consistently produce a reasonable graph, but the code and graph varied each time. This is just one representative result, and in this result, the code is notably more advanced than the code you saw earlier this chapter. In fact, we need a more in depth understanding of the code to be able to walk through it in any real detail so we’re just going to skip any attempt to read through or interpret the code at this point in the book. We can tell you that, at a high-level, it properly imported a Python module designed to make plots (called matplotlib), did some fairly clever data manipulation in the middle using a Python module called numpy, and even had the sense to rotate player names so that they could print well as an x-axis label.

If you go to run this code, you might hit a snag, however. Because Copilot learned from code in GitHub, it doesn’t know what Python modules are installed on your personal machine. The programmers who wrote the code that Copilot learned from likely had matplotlib installed, and matplotlib is the right module to use here, but matplotlib is not a module installed by default in Python. If you don’t have it installed, you’ll get an error when you try to run the code about not finding the “matplotlib” module.

> **Python modules**
>
> Python modules expand the capability of the programming language. There are many modules in Python and they can help you do anything from data analysis to creating websites to writing video games. You can recognize when code wants to use a Python module by the import statement in the code. Python doesn’t automatically install all the modules for you because you likely won’t use most of them. When you want to use a module then, you’ll need to install the package containing the module yourself.

To fix this error, you’ll need to install matplotlib. The good news is that Python has made it really easy to install new packages. Go to the “Terminal” at the bottom right of VSCode and type:

```python
pip install matplotlib
```

> **Note**
> 
> For some operating systems you may need to use `pip3` rather than `pip`. On Windows machines, we recommend using `pip` if you followed our installation instructions. On Mac or Linux machines, we recommend using `pip3`.

When you run this command, you’ll see that a bunch of modules are installed, including numpy (the next module this code wants to use). (matplotlib requires Python modules of its own, so it installs all the modules you need to use matplotlib in addition to matplotlib itself.) When you try to run the code again, you’ll get a plot like this.

> Figure 2.5 The plot produced by the code in listing 2.2.


![](chapter-2.files/chapter-242745.png) 

In this bar graph, we see the y-axis is the number of passing yards and the x-axis is the player’s name. The players are sorted from the fewest yards (with a minimum of 4000) to most yards. Admittedly, it’s not perfect as it is missing a y-axis label and the names on the x-axis are cut off at the bottom, but this is pretty impressive given all we gave Copilot was a pretty short prompt. We could keep adding prompts to see if we can format the graph better, but we’ve already achieved the primary goals for this section which was to show you how powerful Copilot is at helping us write code and to get a feel for how to interact with Copilot.

Indeed, in this chapter, we’ve accomplished a great deal! **If you’ve finished setting up your programming environment and followed along the example with us, you should be proud. You’ve taken a huge step toward writing software!** Beyond the details of setting up your environment, we’ve written software to solve our first problem. Moreover, you’ve observed the process of writing software with Copilot that starts with writing good prompts to help Copilot give us the code we want. In the examples in this chapter, Copilot gave us the code we wanted without us needing to change the prompt or debug the code to figure out why it's not working properly. That was a nice way to showcase the power of using an AI Assistant to program, but you will often find yourself having to test the code, change the prompts, and sometimes try to understand why the code is wrong. This is the AI Assistant programming process that we’ll learn more about in upcoming chapters.
