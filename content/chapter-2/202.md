## 2.2 Getting your system setup

This is actually a four-step process. To streamline this chapter, we’re just providing the main steps for this process below. However, there are more detailed instructions available in the following locations:

* GitHub’s documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot

* In the appendix of this book, there are detailed instructions for setting up your system for both PC and MacOS. As these websites might change after we write this book, we encourage you to use a combination of the link above and the appendix together.

* In the online book forum, you can ask for help and see a list of answers to frequently asked questions.

The primary steps you’ll need to accomplish are as follows:

#### 1. Set up your GitHub account and sign up for Copilot

a. Go to GitHub.com and sign up for a GitHub account: https://github.com/signup

b. Go into your settings in GitHub and enable Copilot. This is the point where you’ll either need to verify you are a student or sign up for the 30-day free trial (available at the time of writing).

#### 2. Install Python

a. Go to the website, [www.Python.org/downloads/](http://www.Python.org/downloads/)

b. Download and install the latest version of Python (3.11.1 at the time of writing).

#### 3. Install Visual Studio Code

a. Go to the website, https://code.visualstudio.com/Download, Select the main download for your Operating System (e.g., Windows Download or Mac Download).

b. Download and install the latest version of Visual Studio Code.

#### 4. Install Visual Studio Code Extensions (please read through https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace for details)

a. Python (by Microsoft). Follow the instructions at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python to set up the Python extension correctly (specifically selecting the correct interpreter).

b. GitHub Copilot (by GitHub)

c. GitHub Copilot Labs (by GitHub). Note that Copilot Labs is not needed for the majority of the book, so if you encounter a waiting list or it has changed from the time of writing, please do not be discouraged.

We know that the steps here are brief, if you encounter any issues, we encourage you to consult the resources mentioned earlier for more detailed setup instructions.
