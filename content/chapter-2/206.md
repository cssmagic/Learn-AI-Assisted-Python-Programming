## 2.6 Summary
## 2.6 本章小结

* You installed Python and VSCode and set up Copilot so you are able to work along with the book and start writing code yourself!
* The VSCode interface has areas for file management, code editing, and running code that will be used throughout the book.
* Prompts are how we tell Copilot to generate code and, when written carefully, can be a highly effective way of creating software.
* Data analysis is a common programming task and .csv files are a common way for storing data to be processed by computers.
* Copilot may generate code that requires you to install additional Python modules.
* Copilot is a powerful tool that is capable of producing code that is as sophisticated (or more) as that produced by college students finishing their first programming course.
