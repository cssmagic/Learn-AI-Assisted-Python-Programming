## 2.4 Addressing common Copilot challenges

It may seem early in your experience with Copilot to start talking about common challenges with Copilot, but you may have already run into this when writing your first program and you’ll certainly encounter some of these working through our next example and in the next chapter, so we wanted to give these to you now.

In our time working with Copilot, we’ve run into a few common challenges. These challenges will likely decrease with time as Copilot improves, but they were still issues at the time of writing. Although the challenges in table 2.1 are not exhaustive of what you might encounter, we hope our tips on how to address these common challenges will help you get up and running quickly. We’ll keep a running list at our book’s website so please feel free to reach out to us on the forums if you feel we’ve missed something!

    <td> <p><a id="idIndexMarker036" href="/book/learn-ai-assisted-python-programming/chapter-2/"></a>Comments only</p> </td>
    <td> <p>If you give Copilot a prompt using the comment symbol (#), when you start a newline, it wants to just give you more comments rather than code. For example:</p> <p><strong><kbd># output "Hello Copilot" to the screen</kbd></strong></p> <p><kbd># print "Hello world" to the screen</kbd></p> <p>We’ve seen Copilot generate line after line of comments, sometimes repeating itself! When this happens, suggestion 3 (use docstrings) is sometimes the most effective.</p> </td>
    <td> <p>1. Add a newline (Enter) between your comment and Copilot’s suggestion to help it switch from comments to code.</p> <p>2. If a newline doesn’t work, you can type a letter or two of code (no comment symbol). A couple letters from a keyword in your prompt usually works. For example:</p> <p><strong><kbd># output "Hello Copilot" to the screen</kbd></strong></p> <p><kbd>pr</kbd></p> <p>A couple letters from a keyword typically causes Copilot to give a code suggestion.</p> <p>3. Switch from using # comments to <a id="idIndexMarker037" href="/book/learn-ai-assisted-python-programming/chapter-2/"></a>docstring comments like this:</p> <p><i><kbd>"""</kbd></i></p> <p><i><kbd>output "Hello Copilot" to the screen</kbd></i></p> <p><i><kbd>"""</kbd></i></p> <p>4. Use Ctrl–Enter to see if Copilot will give you suggestions that are code rather than comments</p> </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td> <p>Wrong code</p> </td>
    <td> <p>Sometimes Copilot just gives you obviously wrong code from the start. (You’ll learn throughout this book how to identify incorrect code!)</p> <p>In addition, sometimes Copilot seems to get stuck down wrong paths. For example, it might seem to be trying to solve a different problem than what you’ve asked it to solve. (Suggestion 3, in particular, can help with getting Copilot to go down a new path.)</p> </td>
    <td> <p>Much of this book is about how to address this problem, but here are some quick tips to get Copilot to help:</p> <p>1. Change your prompt to see if you can better describe what you need.</p> <p>2. Try using Ctrl–Enter to find a suggestion from Copilot that is the correct code.</p> <p>3. Close the VS Code program, wait a little bit, and restart it. This can help clear the Copilot cache to get new suggestions.</p> <p>4. Try breaking down the problem into smaller steps (see chapter 7 for more details).</p> <p>5. Debug the code (see chapter 8).</p> <p>6. Try asking ChatGPT for the code and feed its suggestions into VS Code. A different large language model (LLM) can sometimes give suggestions that help the other LLM to get unstuck.</p> </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td> <p>Copilot gives you</p> <p><kbd># YOUR CODE HERE</kbd></p> </td>
    <td> <p>We’ve had Copilot seem to tell us to write our own code by generating this (or similar text) after a prompt:</p> <p><kbd># YOUR CODE HERE</kbd></p> </td>
    <td> <p>We believe this is happening when we ask Copilot to solve a problem that has been given by an instructor to students to solve in the past. Why? Well, when we write our assignments for our students, we (as instructors) often write some code and then tell our students to write the rest by writing</p> <p><kbd># YOUR CODE HERE</kbd></p> <p>where we want students to write their code. Students tend to leave that comment in their solution code, which means Copilot was trained to think this comment is an important part of the solution (it’s not). Often, we’re able to solve this problem by finding reasonable solutions in the Copilot suggestions with Ctrl–Enter, but please see the solutions for Wrong Code if that doesn’t work.</p> </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td> <p>Missing modules</p> </td>
    <td> <p>Copilot gives you code, but it won’t work because there are modules missing. (Modules are additional libraries that can be added to Python to give prebuilt functionality.)</p> </td>
    <td> <p>See section 2.5, under “Modules” for how to install new modules on your machine.</p> </td>
