# 2 Getting Started with Copilot
# 第二章 快速上手 Copilot

### This chapter covers
### 本章内容概要

* Setting up Python, VS Code, and Copilot on your system
* Introducing the Copilot design process
* Copilot’s value for a basic data processing task

This chapter will help you start working with Copilot on your own machine and familiarize you with how to interact with it. After you are set up with Copilot, we’ll ask that you follow along with our examples when you can. There’s no substitute for practice, and we believe you can learn right alongside us for the remainder of the book.

Once you’ve set up Copilot, we’ll walk through a fun example that showcases the power of Copilot in solving standard tasks, you’ll see how to interact with Copilot, and you’ll learn how we can write software without writing any actual code ourselves.
