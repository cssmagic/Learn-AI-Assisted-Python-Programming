## 4.2 Asking Copilot to explain code

In Chapter 2, when setting up your computer to use GitHub Copilot, you installed the GitHub Copilot Labs extension to Visual Studio Code. This is an experimental extension that is changing rapidly and is designed to offer new features that are not quite ready for everyday use. We're going to show you one of its best features right now: explaining what Python code does!

We suspect that, soon, the Copilot Labs extension, or parts of it, will be folded into the main Copilot extension. If that happens, the specific steps we give here may vary somewhat, and in that case, we encourage you to consult more general GitHub Copilot documentation.

For now, with the Copilot Labs extension installed, you can highlight some code that you want Copilot to describe to you. Let's try this with our `best_word` function.


> Figure 4.1 The Copilot Labs view in VSCode.

First, click on the Copilot Labs tab in your Activity Bar (on the left-hand side of VSCode) and you should see a window similar to figure 4.1.

 

Next, highlight all of the code for our `best_word` function as is highlighted in figure 4.2. (You may need to have Copilot generate the code for you again if you didn't save it from Chapter 3.)

After highlighting the code, you should now see the code appear in the left in the EXPLAIN feature as shown in figure 4.3

Figure 4.4 shows the different prompts provided by Copilot that you can use to ask for code explanations. Each will generally yield different responses that vary in how specific they are and whether they produce fewer or more examples. We'll leave it at the default prompt of “Explain Code,” but if you like, you can try other prompts from the drop-down box (shown in figure 4.4). The current options are "Explain Code," "Code Does Following," "Code Does Following (English)," and "Show Example Code." There's also a "Custom" option that allows you to use whatever prompt you like.

The last step is to click Ask Copilot (as shown as the bottom button in figure 4.3). You'll get an explanation of the code. As usual, Copilot is nondeterministic, so your results will likely differ from ours. In fact, if an explanation is confusing you, you might try clicking Ask Copilot again or changing the prompt to get a different explanation. As educators, this is the start of a dream come true, where students will be able to ask for as many explanations as they need to fully understand how code works.

> **Copilot lab explanations can be wrong**

> As with the code produced by Copilot, the explanations from Copilot Labs can be wrong too. You might be thinking, “Wait, what’s the value of a tool to understand code if it can be wrong?!” First, let us say that we agree, this can be really frustrating. However, it is right often enough in our experience that it can be really helpful, particularly for understanding code basics like the things we’re teaching in these two chapters. Moreover, what students do now when they are confused about their code is to ask friends or websites about the code and, candidly, those make mistakes too. A way to help mitigate the potential for error is to ask Copilot for its explanation a couple of times as you are less likely to get grossly incorrect answers across multiple tries.

Here's what Copilot gave us the first time we asked:

```python
""" Here is the explanation for the code above:
1. We define a function called best_word that takes one argument, word_list. 
2. We define the variables best_word and best_points and set them equal to the empty string and 0, respectively.
3. We use a for loop to iterate over the elements in word_list.
4. We define a variable called points that is equal to the result of calling num_points with word as an argument.
5. We use an if statement to check if points is greater than best_points.
6. If it is, we set best_word equal to word and best_points equal to points.
7. Finally, we return best_word. """
```

To us, this is an excellent description of what the code does line by line. Notice, however, in order to make full sense of it, you need to know important Python terminology and features. The explanation from Copilot above refers to functions, arguments, variables, strings, for loops, if statements, and returning. You know much of this terminology already, but if you did not, then this explanation would be much less useful. By the end of this and the next chapter, you will know the main terminology and features of Python that you need to interpret a typical explanation from Copilot.
