# 4 Reading Python Code: Part 1
# 第四章 阅读 Python 代码（上）

### This chapter covers
### 本章内容概要

* Why knowing how to read code is important
* How to ask Copilot to explain code
* Using functions to break a problem into smaller subproblems
* Using variables to hang on to values
* Using if-statements to make decisions
* Using strings to store and manipulate text
* Using lists to collect and manipulate many values

In Chapter 3, we used Copilot to write several functions for us. What are they good for? Maybe our money_made function could be part of a stock trading system. Maybe our is_strong_password function could be used as part of a social network website. Maybe our best_word function could be used as part of some Scrabble AI. Overall, we’ve written some useful functions that could be part of larger programs. And we did this without writing much code ourselves or, indeed, understanding what the code even does.

However, we believe that you need to understand at a high-level what code does and that this will require some time to learn, hence we’ve split this across two chapters. In this chapter, we’ll explain why reading code is important and introduce you to a Copilot labs feature that can help you understand the code. After that, we'll dive into the top ten programming features you’ll need to be able to recognize in order to read most basic code produced by Copilot. We’ll do the first five in this chapter and the remaining five in the next chapter. Don't worry: you've actually been informally introduced to all ten already—we're just going to deepen your understanding of each one.
