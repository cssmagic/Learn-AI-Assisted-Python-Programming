## 4.3 Top 10 programming features you need to know: Part 1

We're going to give you a whirlwind tour of the ten Python features that you'll need for the rest of your programming journey, starting with the first five of those in this chapter.

Python is an interactive language, which makes it easier than other languages for us to play around and see what stuff does. We'll take advantage of that here as we explore programming features. This is how the two of us learned Python, and indeed how many thousands of programmers have done so.

Don’t hesitate to experiment! To get started, press Ctrl+Shift+P and type REPL, then select Python: Start REPL. This should result in the situation shown in figure 4.5.

This will put you back at the same Python prompt as in Chapter 3 (as shown in figure 4.6), except with none of your functions loaded.

Then we can start typing Python code. For example, type

```
>>> 5 * 4
```

And press ENTER. You'll see the response of `20`. We won't spend time on simple math here, but the way you interact with Python to learn how it works is exactly the same: you type some code and Python responds.

### 4.3.1 #1. Functions

You learned all about functions in Chapter 3, so let's just summarize what we learned.

You use functions to break a large problem into smaller pieces. In retrospect, that `best_word` function that we wrote in Chapter 3 is a pretty big task: it has to figure out which word in a list of words is worth the most points. How many points is a word worth? Aha—-that's a subtask that we can carve out from this function. And, indeed, we had done that in our earlier `num_points` function.

We design a function to take parameters, one parameter for each piece or collection of data that the function needs to do its job. After doing their work, most functions use return to send the answer back to the line of code that called them. When we call a function, we pass values, known as arguments, with one value for each parameter; and we often store that return value using a variable.

For each program we write, we'll likely need to design a few functions—but there are also some functions that are built-in to Python that we get for free. We can call those like we call our own functions. For example, there's a built-in `max` function that takes one or more arguments and tells us the biggest:

```
>>> max(5, 2, 8, 1)
8
```

There's also the `input` function that was used in our `get_strong_password` function from chapter 3. It takes an argument that becomes the prompt, and it returns whatever the user types at the keyboard:

```
>>> name = input("What is your name? ")
What is your name? Dan
>>> name
'Dan'
```

If `input` is the function to receive input from the keyboard, is there an `output` function to output a message to the screen? Well, yes, but it's called `print`, not `output`:

```
>>> print('Hello', name)
Hello Dan
```

### 4.3.2 #2. Variables

A variable is a name that refers to a value. We used variables in Chapter 3 to keep track of return values from functions. We also just used a variable here to hold the user's name. Whenever we need to remember a value for later, we use a variable.

To assign a value to a variable, we use the = (equal sign) symbol, which is called the **assignment** symbol. It figures out the value of whatever is on the right, then assigns that to the variable:

```
>>> age = 20 + 4
>>> age
24
```

> **The `=` symbol is different in Python than in math**
>
> The = sign is used in Python, and other programming languages, to denote **assignment**. The variable on the left side of the equal symbol is given the value of the calculation performed on the right-hand side of the equal symbol. This is _not_ a permanent relationship as the variable can have its value changed. People new to programming who are strong in math can find this confusing, but just remember that the \= sign in Python means assignment, not equality.

We can use the variable in a larger context, called an **expression**. The value that the variable refers to gets substituted for its name:

```
>>> age + 3
27
>>> age
24
```

> **Variables persist in the Python prompt**
>
> We assigned `age` in the earlier batch of code. Why can we keep referring to it? Any variable declared during a session of programming with your Python prompt will stick around until you quit. That’s just how variables work in programs, too: they’re available as soon as you assign a value to them.

But notice that the variable age didn't change when we said age+3! To change it, we need another = assignment statement:

```
>>> age = age + 5
>>> age
29
```

Let's see a few more ways to change what a variable refers to. We'll include some explanations as annotations with the code.

```
>>> age += 5
>>> age
34
>>> age *= 2
>>> age
68
```


### 4.3.3 #3. Conditionals

Whenever our program has to make a decision, we need a conditional statement. For example, back in Chapter 2, we needed to make a decision about which quarterbacks to include in our data. To do so, we used \`if\` statements.

Remember our larger function from Chapter 3? We’ve reproduced it here as listing 4-2.

> Listing 4.2 Function to determine the larger of two values, reprinted from Chapter 3

```python
def larger(num1, num2):
    if num1 > num2:
        return num1
    else:
        return num2
```

The `if-else` structure in listing 4-2 is known as a **conditional** statement, and it allows our program to make decisions. Here, if `num1` is greater than `num2`, then `num1` is returned; else, `num2` is returned. That's how it returns the larger one!

After the word if, we put a Boolean condition (`num1 > num2`). A Boolean condition is an expression that tests a condition where the result would either be `True` or `False`. If it's `True`, then the code under the `if` runs; if it's `False`, then the code under the else runs. We create Boolean expressions using comparison symbols such as `>=` for greater than or equal to, `<` for less than, and `!=` for not equal to. Notice that we’re using indentation not only for the code of the function but also for the code of the `if` and `else` parts of the `if-else` statement. Indentation is necessary for the code to function properly, so this is worth paying attention to (in the next chapter, we talk more about indentation). This is how Python knows which lines of code belong to the function and which additionally belong to the `if` or `else`.

We can play around with conditional statements at the Python prompt, too -— we don't need to be writing code inside of a function. Here's an example:

```
>>> age = 40
>>> if age < 40:
...     print("Binging Friends")
... else:
...     print("What's binging?")
...
What's binging?
```

You'll notice that the prompt changes from `>>>` to `...` when you're typing inside the `if` statement. The change of prompt lets you know that you’re in the middle of typing some code that you need to complete. You need an extra press of enter when you're done with the `else` code to get out of the ... prompt and back to the `>>>` prompt.

We set the age variable to 40. As `40 < 40` is `False`, the `else` runs.

Let's try again, this time making the `if` run:

```
>>> age = 25
>>> if age < 40:
...     print("Binging Friends")
... else:
...     print("What's binging?")
...
Binging Friends
```

You might see some `if` statements with no `else` part, and that's okay: the `else` part is optional. In that case, if the condition is `False` then the `if` statement won't do anything:

```
>>> age = 25
>>> if age == 30:
...     print("You are exactly 30!")
...
```

Notice that the way to test whether two values are equal is to use two equal signs, `==`, not one equal sign. (We already know that one equal sign is for the assignment statement to assign a value to a variable)!

What do you do if you have more than two possible outcomes? For example, let's say that people's age determines the show that they'll likely binge, like this:

> Table 4.1 Possible favorite TV shows by age

<table>
  <thead>
   <tr>
    <th> <p>Age</p> </th>
    <th> <p>Show</p> </th>
   </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
   <tr>
    <td> <p>30–39</p> </td>
    <td> <p>Friends</p> </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td> <p>20–29</p> </td>
    <td> <p>The Office</p> </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td> <p>10–19</p> </td>
    <td> <p>Pretty Little Liars</p> </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td> <p>0–9</p> </td>
    <td> <p>Chi’s Sweet Home</p> </td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>

We can’t capture all these outcomes with just an `if/else`, so the `elif` (short for `else if`) allows us to capture the logic for more than 2 possible outcomes as shown in the code below. We're presenting this without the python prompt (`>>>`) and `...` since this would be a lot to type in!


```python
if age >= 30 and age <= 39:
    print("Binging Friends")
elif age >= 20 and age <= 29:
    print("Binging The Office")
elif age >= 10 and age <= 19:
    print("Binging Pretty Little Liars")
elif age >= 0 and age <= 9:
    print("Binging Chi's Sweet Home")
else:
    print("What's binging?")
```

We're using `and` to capture a complex condition. For example, in the first line, we want age to be greater than or equal to 30 and less than or equal to

39\. Python works from top to bottom, and when it finds a condition that's true, it runs the corresponding indented code. Then it stops checking any remaining `elif`s or `else`-—so if two conditions happened to be true, only the code for the first one would run.

Try experimenting with various values for the age variable to observe that the correct code runs in each case. In fact, if we were serious about testing this code, we could use the `if` statement structure for a good sense of the values we'd want to test. It's all about testing on the boundaries of values. For example, we definitely want to test the ages 30 and 39 to make sure, for example, that we're correctly capturing the full 30-39 range with the first condition. Similarly, we'd want to test 20, 29, 10, 19, 0, 9, and then something larger than 39 to test the else way at the bottom.

If you use additional ifs rather than elifs, then they become separate `if` statements, rather than a single `if` statement. This matters, because Python always checks each independent `if` statement on its own, regardless of what may have happened in above `if` statements.

For example, let's change the `elif`s to `if`s in our age code. That gives us the following:

```python
if age >= 30 and age <= 39:
    print("Binging Friends")
if age >= 20 and age <= 29:
    print("Binging The Office")
if age >= 10 and age <= 19:
    print("Binging Pretty Little Liars")
if age >= 0 and age <= 9:
    print("Binging Chi's Sweet Home")
else:
    print("What's binging?")
```

Suppose that you put `age = 25` above this code and run it. What do you think will happen?

Well, the second `if` condition, `age >= 20 and age <= 29`, is `True`, so we'll certainly output Binging The Office. But that's not all that happens!

Remember: because we're using ifs here, each of the remaining ones is going to be checked. (If they were elifs, we’d be done.) `age >= 10` and `age <= 19` is `False`, so we're not going to output `Binging Pretty Little Liars`.

The final if condition, `age >= 0 and age <= 9`, is also `False`, so we're not going to output `Binging Chi's Sweet Home`. But this `if` has an `else`! So we **are** going to output `What's binging?`. We didn't intend this! We only wanted `What's binging?` for people over 40. This is all to say that `if` and `elif` behave differently, and that we need to be using the one that matches the behavior that we want (`if` if we want multiple chunks of code to potentially run, `elif` if we want only one).

### 4.3.4 #4. Strings

As we learned in Chapter 3, a string is the type that we use whenever we want to store text. Text is everywhere – stats like in Chapter 2, passwords, books – so strings show up in almost every Python program.

We use quotation marks to indicate the beginning and end of the string. You'll see Copilot use double quotes or single quotes. It doesn't matter which you use, just be sure to start and end the string with the same type of quote.

Strings come with a powerful set of methods. A **method** is a function that's associated with a particular type—in this case, strings. The way you call a method is a little different than how you call a function: we need to put the value on which we're calling the method first, outside of the parentheses, followed by a dot.

In Chapter 3, Copilot used some string methods to implement `is_strong_password`. Let's try using those methods here to gain a better understanding of how they work:

```
>>> 'abc'.isupper()
False
>>> 'Abc'.isupper()
False
>>> 'ABC'.isupper()
True

>>> 'abc'.isdigit()
False
>>> '345bc'.isdigit()
False
>>> '345'.isdigit()
True

>>> 'abc6'.isalnum()
True
>>> 'abc def'.isalnum()
False
>>> 'abcdef#'.isalnum()
False
```

There are many other string methods as well. Some help you convert strings between lowercase and uppercase, others help you search a string, and still others help you format a string (for example, centering or right-justifying it).

Copilot's Explain feature can often be helpful if you're not sure what a given string method does. For example, what does this function do?

```python
def clean_number(phone_number):
    phone_number = phone_number.replace('(', '')
    phone_number = phone_number.replace(')', '')
    phone_number = phone_number.replace('-', '')
    return phone_number
```

The first time we asked Copilot to explain, we got this:

```python
""" Here is the explanation for the code above:
1. The replace() method returns a copy of the string in which the occurrences of old have been replaced with new, optionally restricting the number of replacements to max.
2. When we call the replace() method and pass in the value of the first argument, the method will look for that value in the string and replace it with the value of the second argument. If we call the method again and pass in a different value, the method will look for that value and replace it with the value of the second argument. We can call the method as many times as we want to replace as many values as we want.
3. In the above code, we are calling the replace() method three times to replace the '(', ')' and '-' characters in the phone number with empty strings. """
```

This is all accurate information, but one thing it fails to answer is: are we getting rid of every (, ), and - in the phone number, or only the first of each? It turns out that the replace method replaces them all! So, if a phone number had multiple parentheses or dashes, they would all be gone in the returned phone number. The reason that they’re gone is because we’re replacing each with the empty string, and the empty string has no characters. To learn about this nuance of the replace method, you could conduct your own testing using replace at the Python prompt.

Other times, we received very general information about what a function does and what returning a value does—not very helpful in this specific case.

Here's another explanation that we got:

```python
""" Here is the explanation for the code above:
1. First we convert the phone_number argument into a string
2. Then we replace the parentheses and dashes from the string with nothing. This will remove the parentheses and dashes from the string.
3. Then we return the string with the parentheses and dashes removed. """
```

Points 2 and 3 are accurate but point 1 is wrong. We aren't converting anything to a string! This is an example of why we need a baseline of Python knowledge: to help us separate truth from bits of incorrect information.

You'll also often see what look like mathematical operators being used on strings. They are the same as math symbols, but they do different things on strings. The + operator is used to put two strings together, and the \* operator is used to repeat a string a specific number of times. For example:

```
>>> first = 'This is a '
>>> second = 'sentence.'
>>> sentence = first + second
>>> print(sentence)
This is a sentence.
>>> print('-=' * 5)
-=-=-=-=-=
```

### 4.3.5 #5. Lists

A string is great when we have a sequence of characters, like a password or a single Scrabble word. But sometimes we need to store many words or many numbers. For that, we need a list.

We used a list in Chapter 3 for the `best_word` function, because that function needed to work with a list of individual words.

Whereas we use quotation marks to start and end a string, we use opening and closing square brackets to start and end a list. And, as for strings, there are many methods available on lists. To give you an idea of the kinds of list methods available and what they do, let’s explore some of these below:

```
>>> books = ['The Invasion', 'The Encounter', 'The Message']
>>> books
['The Invasion', 'The Encounter', 'The Message']
>>> books.append('The Predator')
>>> books
['The Invasion', 'The Encounter', 'The Message', 'The Predator']
>>> books.reverse()
>>> books
['The Predator', 'The Message', 'The Encounter', 'The Invasion']
```

Many Python types, including strings and lists, allow you to work with particular values using an **index**. The index starts at 0 and goes up to, but not including, the number of values. That is, the first value has index 0 (not index 1!), the second has index 1, and so on. The last value in the list is at the index that’s the length of the list minus 1. The length of the list can be determined by using the len function. For example, if we do len(books), we’ll get a value of 4 (so the valid indices are from 0 up to and including 3). People also often use negative indices, which gives another way to index each value: the rightmost value has index -1, the value to its left has index -2, and so on. Figure 4.7 depicts this example with both positive and negative indexing.

> Figure 4.7 List elements can be accessed through either positive or negative indexes.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cssmagic/Learn-AI-Assisted-Python-Programming/master/content/_figures/4.7.png)


Let's practice indexing on the current books list:

```
>>> books
['The Predator', 'The Message', 'The Encounter', 'The Invasion']
>>> books[0]
'The Predator'
>>> books[1]
'The Message'
>>> books[2]
'The Encounter'
>>> books[3]
'The Invasion'
>>> books[4]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range
>>> books[-1]
'The Invasion'
>>> books[-2]
'The Encounter'
```


We specified 1:3, so you might expect to get the values including index 3. But the value at the second index (the one after the colon) is not included. It's counterintuitive, but true!

If we leave out the starting or ending index, Python uses the start or end as appropriate:

```
>>> books[:3]
['The Predator', 'The Message', 'The Encounter']
>>> books[1:]
['The Message', 'The Encounter', 'The Invasion']
```


We can also use indexing to change a specific value in a list. For example:

```
>>> books
['The Predator', 'The Message', 'The Encounter', 'The Invasion']
>>> books[0] = 'The Android'
>>> books[0]
'The Android'
>>> books[1] = books[1].upper()
>>> books[1]
'THE MESSAGE'
>>> books
['The Android', 'THE MESSAGE', 'The Encounter', 'The Invasion']
```



If we try that on a string, though, we get an error:

```
>>> title = 'The Invasion'
>>> title[0]
'T'
>>> title[1]
'h'
>>> title[-1]
'n'
>>> title[0] = 't'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
```


A string is known as an **immutable** value, which means that you cannot change its characters. You can only create an entirely new string. By contrast, a list is known as a **mutable** value, which means that you can change it.

### 4.3.6 Conclusion

In this chapter, we introduced you to five of the most common code features in Python. We’ll continue with five more in the next chapter. We also showed you how you can use the Copilot explanation tool to help you understand what the code is doing and offered guidance for verifying the veracity of these explanations.
