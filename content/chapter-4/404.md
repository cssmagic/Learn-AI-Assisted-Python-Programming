## 4.4 Summary
## 4.4 本章小结

* We need to be able to read code to determine whether it is correct, test it effectively, and write our own code when needed.
* The Copilot Labs Extension can provide line-by-line explanations of code to explain to you what the code is doing.
* Python has built-in functions such as `max`, `input`, and `print` that we call just like we call our own functions.
* A variable is a name that refers to a value.
* An assignment statement makes a variable refer to a specific value.
* An `if` statement is used to have our programs make decisions and proceed down one of multiple paths.
* A string is used to store and manipulate text.
* A method is a function associated with a particular type.
* A list is used to store and manipulate a general sequence of values (like a sequence of numbers or a sequence of strings).
* Each value in a string or list has an index; indexing starts at 0, not 1.
* Strings are immutable (not changeable); lists are mutable (changeable).
